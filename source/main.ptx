        <title>The Basic Questions</title>
        <p>The three basic questions of combinatorics are:
        
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Enumerative Type: <q>How many...?</q>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Existence Type: <q>Is/Are there...?</q>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Extremal Type: <q>What is the largest/smallest...?</q>
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          While these three question types are central to combinatorics, they appear throughout all of mathematics.  
          In Calculus and Analysis we encounter existence questions and extremal questions, through, for example, the Intermediate Value Theorem and the Extreme Value Theorem, respectively.  
          It's worth noting that we essentially only encounter enumerative questions in Combinatorics and so we will spend the vast majority of our time exploring these kinds of questions.  
          We will, of course, investigate some existence and extremal questions as well.

    <chapter xml:id="ch-two-enumeration">
      <title>Basic Enumeration</title>
      <p>
        In this chapter will explore basic counting ideas.
      </p>
      <section xml:id="sec-two-one-product-rule">
        <title>The Product Rule</title>
        <p>
          Before stating the main counting idea for this section, we will start with a definition.
        </p>
        <definition xml:id="def-bit-string">
          <statement>
            <p>
              A <term>bit string</term> of length <m>n</m> is an element of <m>\{ 0,1\}^n</m>.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </definition>
        <p>
          Note that <m>\{ 0,1\}^n</m> is the usual Cartesian product of <m>\{ 0,1\}</m> with itself <m>n</m> times.  
          The elements of <m>\{ 0,1\}^n</m> are sequences consisting of <m>n</m> <m>0</m>'s and/or <m>1</m>'s.
        </p>
        <p>
          With this definition in hand, one natural question is the following.
        </p>
        <example xml:id="ex-bit-string-length-seven">
          How many bit strings of length <m>7</m> are there?
        </example>
        <p>
          In order to be able to address this question, we first need to introduce the key counting technique for the section.
        </p>
        <theorem xml:id="thm-product-rule">
          <statement>
            <p>
              Suppose that a configuration results from making a sequence of <m>k</m> choices.  
              Furthermore, suppose that for each <m>i</m>, choice <m>i</m> has <m>n_i</m> options available no matter what was selected in previous choices.  
              Then there are <m>n_1\cdot n_2\cdots n_k</m> total configurations.
            </p>
          </statement>
        </theorem>
